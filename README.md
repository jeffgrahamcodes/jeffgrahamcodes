## About Me

I’m a backend-focused software engineer with a strong foundation in Python, Django, and AWS cloud architecture. I bring a systems mindset from my background as a middle school STEM teacher—breaking down complexity, designing for scale, and building solutions meant to last.

I focus on backend services that are cloud-native, secure, observable, and cost-aware.

AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional

I’m currently:
- Building Django-based backend services
- Designing RESTful APIs with authentication and authorization
- Modeling and managing relational data
- Deploying and scaling systems on AWS
- Applying AWS Well-Architected Framework principles in real projects
