# Hi, I’m Jeff Graham

I'm a full-stack software engineer and AWS-certified architect on a mission to become a **unicorn in MLOps** — the intersection of machine learning and DevOps.

---

### What I Do

- **Machine Learning** — Building ML models and deploying intelligent systems
- **DevOps Engineering** — Automating CI/CD, containerizing everything, optimizing cloud workflows
- **Cloud Infrastructure** — AWS Certified (SA Pro, DevOps, SysOps, Security)

---

### Current Focus

- Mastering the end-to-end MLOps lifecycle: from model training to monitored deployment
- Documenting my transition from full-stack to MLOps for others to follow
- Building tools, pipelines, and platforms that enable **intelligent infrastructure at scale**

---

### Why I’m Doing This

As someone from an underrepresented background, I’m not just learning tech —
I’m **breaking in, building up, and bringing others with me**.

---

### Projects in Progress

- `mlops-bootcamp`: A series of beginner-to-advanced MLOps setups
- `aws-ml-deployments`: Serverless ML on AWS with full CI/CD
- `pipeline-starter`: MLOps pipeline templates using GitHub Actions + Docker + monitoring
